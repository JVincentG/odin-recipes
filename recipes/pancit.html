    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lbs. chicken with bones and skin on</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. bihon noodles rice sticks</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. sotanghon noodles green bean thread</li>
        <li>1/2 piece cabbage chopped</li>
        <li>2 piece carrots julienne</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flat leaf parsley chopped</li>
        <li>1 piece onion sliced</li>
        <li>3 stalk celery or celery heart, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 6 cups of water in a cooking pot. Let boil. Put-in the chicken and boil for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the boiled chicken from the cooking pot. Let it cool down. Shred the meat and discard the bones. Set aside. Note: do not throw the water yet, we will use it later as chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, soak the sotanghon and bihon noodles in water for 10 minutes. Set aside. Note: do this by using a large mixing bowl and fill it with tap water.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan. Pour-in 2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
        <li>Let the oil get hot then stir-fry the cabbage and carrots for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>On the same pan, heat the remaining cooking oil. Once the oil becomes smoking hot, saute the onion, celery, and garlic.</li>
        <li>Add the ground black pepper and shredded chicken. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour-in soy sauce and 1 cup of chicken stock (this is the water that was used to boil the chicken). Stir and let boil. Cook for 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked noodles. Toss the noodles until all the ingredients are well blended. If the noodles is somewhat dry, add a cup of chicken stock and continue to toss until the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Put-in the stir-fried cabbage and carrots. Toss.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving plate. Serve with lemon or calamansi.</li>
        <li>Share and enjoy!</li>
